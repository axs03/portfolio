                    <p>Initially, building Power Automate flows and automating data updates using JavaScript helped in setting a baseline for more efficient 
                        and reliable tools. Introducing Git version control for the Inventory Management System was one key factor helping in ease of collaboration
                        with the team. Later, we eventually decided it was time to migrate to Node.js for out backend servers, I assisted in the migration of our backend 
                        codebase into Node.js and mySQL for our database.

                    <p>Currently working as an IT Student Team Manager helps improve my problem solving and leadership skills. Having assisted over 250 students and faculty members, 
                        it is always interesting to see what kind of issue will come up and how you can solve them. As a team, one of our core duties involve managing university technology infrastructure, where we 
                        ensure the systems are up to date and working properly. We have deployed and verified over 500+ Penn State computers using a specially built Operating System used explicitly
                        by Penn State. Using ServiceNow is the tool which allows us to upkeep all of our tasks and incidents helping other team members stay up to speed.

                    <p>For my summer research project, I worked with my Professor alongside a Doctor from Hershey Medical in which we developed 
                        an application pipeline to deliver accurate conversational translations between doctors and non-English speaking patients.
                        This involved "integrating" Meta's SeamlessM4T-v2 Natural Language Processing model into an iOS application. We used Python's transformers for 
                        the NLP model itself, and successfully containerized the entire environment using Docker for our API deployment. Custom API endpoints were made possible
                        using Gunicorn with Flask. AWS SageMaker, S3 bucket, and an EC2 instance all played big roles in the deployment process. For our iOS application,
                        we used TestFlight for our beta testing and user feedback (even though only 8 people were on it). </p>

                    <p>As a Full Stack Intern, I collaborated with with senior developers to implement a 17% more efficient file tracking system using Python and Angular.
                        Most of it included data preprocessing and the migration to an SQL database managed by PHPmyadmin. This helped me get a solid foundation with 
                        Object Oriented programming and fluency in writing production. Introducing proper versioning into the API helped improve its repsonse time as well.
                        Alongside, I used pytest for generating unit tests and debugging code for resolving minor issues to ensure optimal performance.
