                <p>Initially, building Power Automate flows and automating data updates using JavaScript helped in setting a baseline for more efficient

                <p>Worked on a research project with my Professor alongside a Doctor from Hershey Medical where our main goal was to develop

                    <p>We used Python's transformers for the NLP model itself, and successfully containerized the entire environment using Docker for our API deployment. 
                    <br>Custom API endpoints were made possible using Gunicorn for production with Flask. AWS SageMaker, S3 bucket, and an EC2 instance all 
                    played big roles in the deployment process. Using TestFlight for our beta testers helped get valuable user feedback. </p>

                    <br>Introducing proper versioning into the API helped improve its repsonse time as well.
                    Unit Tests were written in pytest, it made it quite easy for debugging code and resolving minor issues to ensure optimal performance.
